  Features
  As the headphones all others are measured against, the XX99 Mark I demonstrates over five decades 
  of audio expertise, redefining the critical listening experience. This pair of closed-back headphones 
  are made of industrial, aerospace-grade materials to emphasize durability at a relatively light weight of 11 oz.

  From the handcrafted microfiber ear cushions to the robust metal headband with inner damping element, 
  the components work together to deliver comfort and uncompromising sound. Its closed-back design delivers 
  up to 27 dB of passive noise cancellation, reducing resonance by reflecting sound to a dedicated absorber. 
  For connectivity, a specially tuned cable is included with a balanced gold connector.
